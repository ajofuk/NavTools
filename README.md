# NavTools
This is my efforts to create python based tools to assist in shipboard navigational planning

## Achieved

Extracting waypoints and turn data from an ECPINS .rte file
Calculating distance to new course for a given turn when provided with advance and transfer in yards, along with degrees of turn.
Calculating GEOJSON lat/long points for wheel over point and countdown every 1c from 1nm before turn
Calculating bearing to a fixed reference point at each count down point

## To Do

Full test of countdown bearing function \
Calculate length of leg between two waypoints, from steady on course to wheel over point \
Investigate how to make ECPINS .rfp reference point sets readable
In lieu of reading ECPINS .rfp reference point sets, create alternative GEOJSON reference point sets
Calculate head/sternmark 1 degree XTD along leg
Extract tidal data from ECPINS .rte file

## Contact

Please do reach out if you have any interest in this, especially if you have Python, ECPINS or general sea navigation experience.
